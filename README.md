# HousePricePrediction_Bharatintern

🎉 Excited to share that I've successfully completed Task 1, "House Price Prediction," as part of my Machine Learning internship with Bharat Intern!
🔍 In this project, I applied Python and various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on several factors such as location, size, and amenities. This experience has strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
💡 A big thanks to the Bharat Intern team for providing this opportunity and guiding me through this enriching learning journey!
